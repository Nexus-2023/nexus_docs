# ðŸš² Nexus Testnet

Nexus Network has launched a Testnet that showcases how it provides secure yields to the Rollup with minimum change in its tech stack. \
For testing Nexus Network Rollup a user needs to follow the following steps:

1. You will need ETH on Holesky testnet to bridge. Check out these faucets if you do not have ETH already -

   1. Navigate to [https://testnet.app.nexusnetwork.live](https://t.co/T9aSBwk7O1)
   2. Connect your wallet, and move ETH to the Nexus Network testnet. The assets will get bridged within 10 minutes
3. For bridging the funds back to holeky:
   1. Switch the network to Nexus Network.
   2. Start the bridging by selecting the amount of ETH
